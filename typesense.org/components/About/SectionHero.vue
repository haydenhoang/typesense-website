            team of engineers passionate about making great search technology
            accessible to everyone. We believe that search technology choices
            widely available to developers today, either have a steep learning
            curve and a heavy operational burden, or are proprietary and
            expensive.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>We are on a mission to democratize search</strong>. We want
            to reduce the time-to-market for developers to build a blazing-fast
            search experience that provides relevant results out-of-the-box, all
            without breaking the bank and without operational overhead.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are a small team trying to do big things and we believe that open
            sourcing our work helps combine forces with our community and
            force-multiply our collective efforts. If this resonates with you,
