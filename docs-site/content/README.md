# Typesense Documentation

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! Let's get you up and searching. 

The documentation is divided into the following sections, that you'll find links for on the **top navigation bar** as well.

## Typesense Versions

Typesense is versioned software and each version has API documentation specifically tied to it. 
You can use the dropdown on the top navigation bar to switch between versions.

But here are direct clickable links as well:

<ul>
  <li v-for="version in $site.themeConfig.typesenseVersions">
    <RouterLink :to="`${version}/`"> {{version}} </RouterLink>
  </li>
</ul>
