## What's new

This release contains important new features, performance improvements and bug fixes.

### New Versioning Scheme

Starting with this release, we're dropping the `0.x.y` versioning scheming and switching to a `x.y` versioning scheme. 

So we're going from `0.25 --> 26.0`.

Typesense has been production-ready for a few years now, and is actively used at scale in production, serving billions of search requests per month just on Typesense Cloud, and several billions more in self-hosted clusters.

We originally intended the `0.x` versioning scheme to communicate that there might be backward in-compatible changes between versions. 
In reality though, we've only had to do two backward incompatible changes over the years. 
However, the usage of the previous `0.x` versioning scheme seemed to mis-communicate Typesense's production-readiness among new users, causing confusion.

Switching from `0.x` to `1.x` also seemed to mis-communicate the progress and feature-set maturity we've built over the years.
So we decided to simply drop the `0.` and switch to whole numbers for major versions, to convey Typesense's progress over the last 8 years.

### New Features

- **Built-in Conversational Search (RAG):** You can now seamlessly run a semantic search and then pass the result to an LLM
  for summarizing the result as an answer.
  - Built-in support for OpenAI and Cloudflare Workers AI hosted models.
  - [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/26.0/api/conversational-search-rag.html)
- **Image Search:** Search through images using text descriptions of their contents, or perform similarity searches, using the CLIP model.
  - [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/26.0/api/image-search.html)
- **Voice Search:** Capture and send query via voice recordings -- Typesense will transcribe (via Whisper model) and provide search results.
  - [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/26.0/api/voice-search-query.html)
- **JOINs:** Connect one or more collections via common reference fields and join them during query time. This
  allows you to model SQL-like relationships elegantly.
  - [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/26.0/api/joins.html)
- **Search Personalization using Historical Queries:** The `vector_query` parameter in Vector Search supports a `qs` parameter (stands for plural of the `q` parameter) that accepts a
  comma-separated list of historical search queries. We compute the average embedding of these queries and use that as the vector for search.
  - [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/26.0/api/vector-search.html#searching-with-historical-queries) 
- **Analytics:**
  - Ability to track queries that don't produce hits. [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/26.0/api/analytics-query-suggestions.html#no-hits-queries)
  - Ability to track counts of document-level analytics (eg: clicks, views, etc) to improve search relevance. [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/26.0/api/analytics-query-suggestions.html#counting-events-for-popularity)
- **Sorting based on Filter Score:** You can now use `_eval` in `sort_by` and assign scores to records that match particular filters, to boost or bury a set of records together.
  the filter expression.
  - [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/26.0/api/search.html#sorting-based-on-filter-score)
- **Stemming:** Allows handling common word variations of the same root word. This is helpful for different word-forms of the same root word (eg: plurals / singular).
  - Eg: Searching for `walking`, will also return results with `walk`, `walked`, `walks`, etc when stemming is enabled.
  - [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/26.0/api/collections.html#schema-parameters). See the `stem: true` property under the `fields` parameter.
- **Prefix Filtering:** During filtering, you can now query on records that begin with a given prefix string. 
  - Eg: `company_name: Acm*` will return names that begin with `acm`.
  - Previously, only full-word or full-attribute-value matching was possible in `filter_by` and only `q` supported prefix matches.
- **Stop Words:** Specify a list of common words (e.g.`a`, `am`, `the`, `are`, etc.) that should be excluded from the indexing and search process to improve search relevance and performance.
  - [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/26.0/api/stopwords.html)
- **Curate / Override by Tags:** You can tag override rules with tags and then trigger curation by referring to the rule
  by the tag name directly at search time.
  - [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/26.0/api/curation.html#add-tags-to-rules)


### Enhancements

- Collection schema changes only block writes now, and reads will be serviced as usual. Previously both reads and writes were blocked. 
- **Sort facets alphabetically or by the value of another field:** Sort facet values can now be sorted in
  alphabetical order for display via `"facet_by": "phone(sort_by: _alpha:asc)"` or on the value of another field
  via `"facet_by": "recipe.name(sort_by: recipe.calories:asc)"`
- **Fetching parent of faceted field:** When you facet on a nested field like `color.name` you can now set
  `"facet_return_parent": "color.name"`. This will return the parent color object as parent property in the facet response.
- **Improved faceting and filtering performance:** Query planner has been optimized to handle many common patterns better.
- **NOT contains**: Exclude results that contains a specific string during filtering. For example, `"filter_by": "artist:! Jackson"`
  will exclude all documents whose `artist` field value contains the word `jackson`.
- **Excluding IDs via filtering:** The `id` field now support the `:!=` operation, so `"filter_by": "id:!=[id1, id2]"`
  will exclude documents that have an `id` value of `id1` or `id2`.
- **Configurable HNSW Parameters:** `M`, `efConstruction` and `efSearch` have been made configurable.
- **Disable typos for numerical tokens:** Use `enable_typos_for_numerical_tokens: false` parameter to disable typos on numerical.
- **Customize URL for OpenAI embedding API:** This allows you to use other OpenAI compatible APIs.
- **Pagination for collections, synonyms & overrides listing:** These API end-points now support `limit` and `offset` GET parameters.
- **Store custom metadata with collection schema:** While creating a collection you can send a `metadata` object field,
  which is persisted along with collection schema. This is useful for record keeping.
- **Store metadata with override rules:** Store a `metadata` object within an override, so that the search end-point response
  will return the pre-defined metadata associated for that rule. This can can be used to display a message on the front-end.
- **Faster numerical range queries:** You can set `range_index: true` in a field's schema for fast range queries 
  (this will incur additional memory overhead though).
- Prevent the contents of a field from being stored on-disk via the `store: false` field property.
- Expose information about applied typo tolerance or dropped tokens in `text_match_info` response.
- Option to ignore "not found" error when deleting an object that's already deleted.
- Allow a field which is configured as `index: false` + `optional: false`. Previously this was not allowed.
- Exposed swap usage as a metric in `/metrics.json` API.
- The `/health` API returns additional information about memory/disk exhaustion.
- Support overriding wildcard query via `"q": "*"` in rules.
- Build support for Apple M1 / M2 / M3
- Add option to expand prefix search query via the `expand_query` parameter for suggestion aggregation.
- Auto deletion of expired API keys when the `autodelete: true` property is set during key creation.
- Make the size of search cache configurable via the `--cache-num-entries` server flag. Default is `1000`.
- Add flag for logging search query at the start of req cycle.
- Improved on-disk compaction: prunes older records more aggressively, leading to better bounds on data storage.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed multiple synonym substitutions in query yielding no results.
- Fix `typo_tokens_threshold` not considering the number of grouped hits.
- Fixed odd behavior when `_eval` condition in `sort_by` contained a comma.
- Fixed `object` type auto-creating schema for nested fields even for non-indexed fields.
- Fixed open quote present in search query treated as phrase search.
- Fixed facet by range not working with decimal numbers or with numerical labels or labels that contain spaces.
- Fixed extra new line showing up in the import API response.
- Fixed face range end values being exclusive in nature when it should be inclusive.
- Fixed edge cases in handling unicode in German / Thai locales.
- Fixed facet counts being incorrect when combined with grouping and pinning.
- Fixed highlighting quirks on long documents.
- Fixed inheritance of sort field property for nested fields.
- Fixed propagation of dynamic field properties for child nested fields.
- Fixed some edge cases in phrase search.
- Fixed update doc API returning 200 status code, instead of 201.

### Deprecations / behavior changes

We refactored the faceting data structures to improve efficiency. This had an impact on how the `total_values` in 
`facet_stats` is computed for low-cardinality facet fields: it's now computed only within the 
results returned, instead of on the whole dataset. To get the correct value, use Typesense `v27` and 
send this additional search parameter:

```
"facet_strategy": "exhaustive"
```

This will force Typesense to compute facets in an exhaustive manner and allows the `total_values` to be exact.

## Upgrading

Before upgrading your existing Typesense cluster to v{{ $page.typesenseVersion }}, please review the behavior
changes above to prepare your application for the upgrade.

We'd recommend testing on your development / staging environments before upgrading. 

### Typesense Cloud

If you're on Typesense Cloud:

1. Go to [https://cloud.typesense.org/clusters](https://cloud.typesense.org/clusters).
2. Click on your cluster
3. Click on "Cluster Configuration" on the left-side pane, and then click on "Modify"
4. Select a new Typesense Server version in the dropdown
5. Schedule a time for the upgrade.

### Self Hosted

If you're self-hosting Typesense, here's how to upgrade:

#### Single node deployment

1. Trigger a snapshot to [create a backup](https://typesense.org/docs/26.0/api/cluster-operations.html#create-snapshot-for-backups) of your data, for safety purposes.
2. Stop Typesense server.
3. Replace the binary via the tar package or via the DEB/RPM installer. 
4. Start Typesense server back again.

#### Multi-node deployment

To upgrade a multi-node cluster, we will be proceeding node by node to ensure the cluster remains healthy during the rolling upgrade.

**NOTE:** During the upgrade, we have to ensure that the leader of the cluster is using the **older** Typesense version. 
So we will upgrade the leader last. You can determine whether a node is a leader or follower by the value of the `state` 
field in the `/debug` end-point response.

| State | Role     |
|-------|----------|
| 1     | LEADER   |
| 4     | FOLLOWER |

1. Trigger a snapshot to [create a backup](https://typesense.org/docs/26.0/api/cluster-operations.html#create-snapshot-for-backups) of your data 
   on the leader node.
2. On any follower, stop Typesense and replace the binary via the tar package or via the DEB/RPM installer.
3. Start Typesense server back again and wait for node to rejoin the cluster as a follower and catch-up (`/health` should return healthy). 
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the other _followers_, leaving the leader node uninterrupted for now.
5. Once all followers have been upgraded to v{{ $page.typesenseVersion }}, stop Typesense on the leader.
6. The other nodes will elect a new leader and keep working. 
7. Replace the binary on the old leader and start the Typesense server back again. 
8. This node will re-join the cluster as a follower, and we are done.


## Downgrading

Once you upgrade to `v26` of Typesense Server, you can only downgrade back to `v0.25.x`.
