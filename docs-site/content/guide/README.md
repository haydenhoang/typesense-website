# Typesense Guide

The guide section of the documentation walks you through how to use Typesense in different scenarios. 

For a high-level overview of Typesense, what you can use it for, and some live-demos, read the [**Overview**](../overview/README.md) section. 
For a detailed dive into the Typesense API, refer to our <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/`"><strong>API Documentation</strong></RouterLink>.

## Quick Start

For a quick step-by-step walk-through, follow these articles in the order below:

1. Skim through Typesense's [key Use-Cases](../overview/use-cases.md) (It's much more than full text search) and [Live Demos](../overview/demos.md)
2. [Install Typesense](./install-typesense.md)
3. [Install a Client Library](./installing-a-client.md)
4. [Build a Search Application](./building-a-search-application.md)
5. [Build a Search UI](./search-ui-components.md)
6. If you're an Algolia user, follow the [Migrating from Algolia](./migrating-from-algolia.md) guide
7. For documentation site search, follow the [DocSearch](./docsearch.md) guide
8. Review [Best Practices](./running-in-production.md)

Read through the rest of the guide using the links in the left-side pane.

For a detailed dive into the Typesense API, refer to our <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/`"><strong>API Documentation</strong></RouterLink>.

### Getting Help

We've strived to keep Typesense as self-service and out-of-the-box as possible, with fully public documentation.
