# Tips for Locale-Specific Search

In this article, we'll talk about how to handle locale-specific text in your
Typesense collections. We'll cover:

- [Default Behavior and English Text](#default-behavior-and-english-text)
- [Language Code Support](#language-code-support)
- [Commonly Used Languages](#commonly-used-languages)
- [Language-Specific Features](#language-specific-features)
- [Advanced Tokenization Options](#advanced-tokenization-options)
- [Best Practices](#best-practices)

## Basic Locale Configuration

To enable language-specific text handling, specify the locale when defining your
collection's schema using the `locale` parameter in the field definition:

```json
{
  "name": "posts",
  "fields": [
    { "name": "title", "type": "string", "locale": "vi" },
    { "name": "description", "type": "string", "locale": "en" }
  ]
}
```

Each field can have its own locale setting, allowing you to handle multilingual
content within the same document.

## Default Behavior and English Text

When no locale is specified for a field, Typesense treats it as English (`en`)
by default. This has important implications:

- For default English fields, diacritics (accent marks) are automatically
  removed from European accented characters
- For non-English locales, diacritics are preserved due to ICU (International
  Components for Unicode) tokenization

This affects search behavior in important ways:

- When searching fields with preserved diacritics, an exact match with accents
  will be prioritized
- Due to typo tolerance, if no exact accented match is found, non-accented
  versions will be matched
- For optimal matching, consider your users' likely search patterns when
  deciding whether to preserve diacritics

## Language Code Support

Typesense supports any valid two-letter
[ISO 639-1 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes).
This means you're not limited to just the commonly documented languages - you
can use any standard language code like:

- `vi` for Vietnamese
- `id` for Indonesian
- `ms` for Malay
- `nl` for Dutch
- `pl` for Polish
- etc.

The locale parameter accepts any valid ISO 639-1 code and will use the
appropriate ICU rules for that language.

### How It Works

When you specify a locale:

1. Typesense uses ICU libraries for language processing
1. The two-letter code is passed directly to ICU's locale handler
1. Appropriate language rules are applied for tokenization and text processing

### Setting the Locale

```json
{
  "fields": [
    { "name": "title", "type": "string", "locale": "ANY-VALID-ISO-CODE" }
  ]
}
```

Where `ANY-VALID-ISO-CODE` can be any standard two-letter language code.

## Commonly Used Languages

While any ISO 639-1 code works, here are some commonly used languages with their
codes:

| Language   | Code | Notes                                    |
| ---------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------- |

| Dutch      | `nl` |                                          |
| English    | `en` | Default if no locale specified           |
| French     | `fr` |                                          |
| German     | `de` |                                          |
| Hindi      | `hi` |                                          |
| Indonesian | `id` |                                          |
| Italian    | `it` |                                          |
| Japanese   | `ja` |                                          |
| Korean     | `ko` |                                          |
| Malay      | `ms` |                                          |
| Polish     | `pl` |                                          |
| Portuguese | `pt` |                                          |
| Russian    | `ru` | Cyrillic script                          |
| Greek      | `el` | Cyrillic script                          |
| Spanish    | `es` |                                          |
| Thai       | `th` |                                          |
| Turkish    | `tr` |                                          |
| Vietnamese | `vi` |                                          |

## Language-Specific Features

Different language families receive specialized handling:

### Script-Based Features

- **CJK Languages** (Chinese, Japanese, Korean)
  - Word segmentation without spaces
  - Character variant handling

- **Right-to-Left Scripts** (Arabic, Hebrew)
  - Proper text direction handling
  - Special character normalization

- **Languages with Special Characters**
  - Diacritic handling
  - Special character normalization
  - Proper collation

### Word Segmentation

Some languages receive special word segmentation handling:

- **Thai**: No spaces between words, requires special breaking rules
- **Japanese**: Mixed kanji-kana text segmentation
- **Vietnamese**: Proper handling of tone marks and compounds
- **Chinese**: Character-based segmentation and variant handling

## Advanced Tokenization Options

### Custom Tokenization with `pre_segmented_query`

For languages with complex word boundaries or when you need more control over
tokenization, Typesense offers the `pre_segmented_query` parameter. This feature
allows you to:

1. Use your own tokenizer for both indexing and querying
1. Have Typesense simply split on spaces rather than applying its default
   tokenization rules

This is particularly useful for:

- Chinese and other CJK languages where ML-based word splitting might be more
  accurate
- Languages with complex compound words
- Special domain-specific tokenization needs

Example usage:

```json
{
  "q": "pre tokenized query",
  "pre_segmented_query": true
}
```

When using this feature, ensure that:

- Your indexing tokenization matches your query tokenization
- Tokens are space-separated in both indexed content and queries
- You maintain consistency in your tokenization approach

## Best Practices

1. **Always Specify the Locale** if it's not an English field.

   ```json
   {
     "fields": [
       { "name": "title_vi", "type": "string", "locale": "vi" },
       { "name": "title_th", "type": "string", "locale": "th" }
     ]
   }
   ```

1. **Field Naming Convention** Include the language code in field names for
   multilingual content:

   ```json
   {
     "title_en": "English Title",
     "title_vi": "Tiêu đề tiếng Việt",
     "title_th": "ชื่อเรื่องภาษาไทย"
   }
   ```

1. **Consider Diacritic Handling**
   
    For European languages, consider whether your users are likely to search with or without diacritics.

1. **Custom Tokenization**
    
    Consider using `pre_segmented_query` for languages where default tokenization might not be optimal.
