## Keyword Search

### What is prefix search?

If you have a word like `example` in your dataset, and you search for `exa` (the first 3 characters), that will still return the word `example` in prefix search mode (`prefix=true` search parameter).

The following are all other search terms that will return the word `example` as a match during a prefix search:

- `e`
- `ex`
- `exa`
- `exam`
- `examp`
- `exampl`
- `example`

This is helpful when building search-as-you-type experiences where the user types in one character at a time, and you want to show results immediately, even with partial terms.

You can think of prefix search as a "startsWith" search - the search term should occur at the beginning of a string, to be considered a match.

Prefix search is enabled by default in Typesense.
But if you disable prefix search (by setting `prefix=false` as a search parameter), then only typing out `example` fully as a search keyword will return it as the result, and all the other substrings of `example` above will not return the result.

### What is infix search?

If you have a word like `example` in your dataset, and you search for `xa` (which appears in the middle of the string), by default Typesense will not return it, since only [prefix search](#what-is-prefix-search) is enabled by default.

If you want to search in the middle of strings, that's called `infix` search and has to be explicitly enabled for each field.

In the field definition, in the collection schema, add the `infix: true` parameter documented <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/collections.html#field-parameters`">here</RouterLink>, and then use the `infix` search parameter documented <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/search.html#query-parameters`">here </RouterLink> at search time.

:::warning
Infix search is CPU intensive, and requires additional memory. For high-traffic use-cases, make sure to benchmark your cluster to ensure that you have sufficient CPU capacity before enabling this feature.
:::

If you have [special characters](#how-do-i-handle-special-characters) in words, a more efficient alternative would be to use `token_separators` in the collection schema, to have Typesense index the words as separate tokens, so you can search on each token without having to do infix search. 

### How do I handle special characters?

By default, Typesense removes all special characters before indexing.
You can use the `token_separators` and `symbols_to_index` parameters to control this behavior. 

[Here](./tips-for-searching-common-types-of-data.md) is a detailed article with examples on how to use these two parameters, when searching through different types of data.

### How do I handle singular / plural variations of a keyword?

You can use the stemming feature to allow search queries that contain variations of a word in your dataset (eg: singular / plurals, tense changes, etc) to still match the record.

For eg: searching for `walking`, will also return results with `walk`, `walked`, `walks`, etc when stemming is enabled.

You can enable stemming by setting the <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/collections.html#field-parameters`">`stem: true`</RouterLink> parameter in the field definition in the collection schema. 

### When I search for a short string, I don't get all results. How do I address this?

By default, Typesense only considers the top 4 prefix matches, for performance reasons.

Here's an example:

Searching for "ap", will match records with "apple", "apply", "apart", "apron", or any of hundreds of similar words that start with "ap" in your dataset. Also, searching for "jofn", will match records with "john", "joan" and all similar variations that are 1-typo away in your dataset. 

But for performance reasons, Typesense will only consider the top `4` prefixes and typo variations by default. The `4` is configurable using the `max_candidates` search parameter, documented <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/search.html#ranking-and-sorting-parameters`">here</RouterLink>.

In short, if you search for a short term like say "a", and not all the records you expect are returned, you want to increase `max_candidates` to a higher value and/or change the <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/collections.html#schema-parameters`">`default_sorting_field`</RouterLink> in the collection schema to define "top" using some popularity score in your records, without which Typesense will just use the count of each records for each prefix to define top.

### Why does the order of keywords change the number of results?

There are usually a few reasons for this:

1. By default, Typesense only does a [prefix search](#what-is-prefix-search) on the last word in the search query.

   For example:
   
   Let's say you search for `hello worl`, only `worl` will be used for prefix search and `hello` will be expected to match fully.
   
   So all the following records will be returned for a (prefix) search query of `hello worl`:
   
   - ✅ `hello world`
   - ✅ `hello worlds`
   - ✅ `hello worldwide`
   - ✅ `hello worldwide`
   - ✅ `hello worldy`
   - ✅ `hello worldly`
   
   But the following records will NOT be returned for a search query of `hello world`:
   
   - ❌ `hellow world`
   - ❌ `hellowy world`
   - ❌ `hellos world`
   - ❌ `hellowing world`
   
   This is because `hello` is not prefix searched, since it's not the last term in the search query.
   
   But if the order of the search terms is now flipped and the search query is now `world hello`, then the four records above will now be returned, since `hello` is now prefix searched.
   
   If you want to disable prefix searching, you can set `prefix=false`. 

2. By default, when no results are found for a multi-keyword search query, then Typesense will start dropping words in the query one at a time, and repeat the search until enough results are found.

   The definition of "enough" above can be configured using the <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/search.html#search-parameters`">`drop_tokens_threshold`</RouterLink> search parameter and the direction of the dropping (left to right vs right to left) can be configured using the  <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/search.html#search-parameters`">`drop_tokens_mode`</RouterLink> parameter.
   
   So if the search query is `hello world`, and none of the records have all keywords, then Typesense will drop `world` and repeat the search for `hello`.
   Now, if the search query is `wordl hello`, and none of the records have all keywords, then Typesense will drop `hello` this time and repeat the search, which will produce different results compared to the previous time.

### How do I do search multiple collections and combine the results in a single ranked list?

When doing federated / multi search, the `text_match` score returned by Typesense with every hit can be used to compare documents' relevance from different collections, and aggregate the results client-side.
However, pagination might become tricky with this client-side aggregation approach.

An alternate approach would be to store your different document types in a _single_ collection (you want to set all collection fields as `optional: true` in the schema), along with say a `document_type` field that tells you the record type, so you can access the appropriate fields for that document type in your application.

For eg, let's say you have two types of data called `products` and `articles` and want to show the results in a single list.
You can create a single collection with both products and articles, set all fields as optional, add a field called `document_type: product | article` to identify if a document is a product or an article. 
When you send a search query, now both types of records are returned in the same ranked list, and you can use the `document_type` field to visually differentiate each type of record in your search interface.

### How do I ensure that all keywords in my search query are present in the returned results?

You want to set `drop_tokens_threshold: 0` as a search parameter. 

For more context on how this works, please read this section below: [The `q` search parameter](#the-q-search-parameter)

### Can I implement Boolean Search with Typesense?

Yes, but with some caveats, that require additional consideration.

Let's start with some background context about the features that you can use to implement Boolean Search. 

#### The `q` search parameter

Typesense has a <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/search.html#search-parameters`">search parameter</RouterLink> called `q` 
that accepts any **full-text** search terms. The provided search terms are searched for across any of the fields mentioned in the `query_by` search parameter.

Now, if there are no records in your dataset where all the provided search terms are found in the same document, then by default Typesense will start 
dropping search terms in the `q` parameter, one by one, left to right and repeat the search operation, until enough search results are found.

The threshold for "enough" results in the above statement can be configured using the `drop_tokens_threshold` search parameter and 
the direction of the dropping of keywords can be configured using the `drop_tokens_mode` search parameter.

For eg: let's say you're doing the following search:

```json
{
  "q": "senior software engineering manager",
  "query_by": "job_title,seniority",
  "drop_tokens_threshold": 10,
  "drop_tokens_mode": "right_to_left"
}
```

1. Typesense will first look for a record that contains all 4 search terms - `senior`, `software`, `engineering` and `manager` in the **same record**, across the `job_title` and `seniority` fields.
2. If there are less than `10` records found (which is configured using `drop_tokens_threshold`), Typesense will continue dropping search terms and this time, drop the search term `manager` and repeat the search for `senior software engineering`. 
3. Now, if there are at least `10 records` found for this modified query, Typesense will stop the search and return those results.
4. But, if there are still less than `10` records found, Typesense will now drop another search term `engineering` and repeat the search for `senior software`.
5. If there are still less than `10` records found, Typesense will drop another term and repeat the search for just `senior`.

This process will continue until at least 10 results are found, or there's only 1 search term left in the original search query. 

##### Using token-dropping for OR Search:

With the feature explained above, if you set `drop_tokens_threshold: 10000000` (essentially any large number that's higher than the total number of documents in your dataset),
and `drop_tokens_mode: both_sides:3`, then Typesense will essentially drop every keyword in your search query, one-by-one, from both directions and repeat the search multiple times, which is essentially an OR operation.

You can also use quotes around particular search terms to group them together. For eg: `senior "software engineering" manager` will ensure that `software engineering` always exists in the that same order in the record, for it to be considered a match and the other search terms are considered optional.

##### Disabling token-dropping for AND Search:

With the feature explained above, if you set `drop_tokens_threshold: 0`, that disables the feature and Typesense will only return records where ALL the search terms mentioned in the query are present in the same record.

#### Boolean Search using the `filter_by` search parameter:

If you need to do more structured queries, then you can use the <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/search.html#filter-parameters`">`filter_by` search parameter</RouterLink>, 
which supports complex boolean expressions with precedence, etc.

For eg, let's say we want to search for `software engineering lead` OR `software engineering manager` in the same search query.

You could do something like this:

```json
{
  "q": "*",
  "filter_by": "job_title:[software engineering lead, software engineering manager]"
}
```

If we want to search for `software engineering lead` records, which have a job location as `remote` or `hyrbid`, we would do:

```json
{
  "q": "*",
  "filter_by": "job_title:software engineering lead && job_location:[remote, hybrid]"
}
```

You could also do "starts with" matching using filter_by. For eg, say we want to find all records where the title starts with `software`, you could do:

```json
{
  "q": "*",
  "filter_by": "job_title:=software*"
}
```


## Semantic Search

### How do I fine-tune semantic search results?

The quality of semantic search results is completely dependent on the ML model you use to generate the embeddings, and what training dataset was used to originally train the model, among other things like number of dimensions.

Typesense essentially takes your search query, generates embeddings for it using the ML model you've specified, then does a nearest-neighbor vector search and sorts the results based on the cosine similarity between the query embedding and each document's embedding.
With this mode of search, there is no binary concept of "does it match" or not for each document, unlike in standard keyword search. Instead, every document has a vector distance score that defines how close it is to the query embeddings.

So if you find that you're getting too many irrelevant results with semantic search, you can use the `distance_threshold` parameter in `vector_query` to pick an appropriate threshold that works for your use case. Read more about this <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/vector-search.html#distance-threshold`">here</RouterLink>.

If you're using Hybrid Search, you can control the weightage of keyword vs semantic matches using the `alpha` parameter of `vector_query`. Read more about this <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/vector-search.html#weightage-for-semantic-vs-keyword-matches`">here</RouterLink>.

You can also try using a different ML model that was trained using a dataset that's closer to your domain, to generate better emebeddings.

## Faceting

### How do I get facet counts for values that users have not filtered on?

Let's say you have a Songs Search UI, where you want to show a filter widget that users can use to filter on Artists:

<img src="~@images/faqs/artists-filter-widget.png" alt="Filter by Artists" height="400">

Initially when you do `facet_by: artist`, you'll get facet counts for all artist names in the search results.

However, once you apply `filter_by: artist:=The Beatles`, and then facet by `artist`, now the result set will only contain documents where `artist` is `The Beatles`, so the facet counts will only contain this value.

But you'd still want to show counts for the unfiltered / unselected items to the user. For eg, in the image above, you'd still want to fetch counts for `Various Artists`, `Hello`, `Hello Searhorse!`, etc.

To fetch these counts, you'd need to do a second search query where you remove the `filter_by` selected by the user and only send the `facet_by: artist` parameter.
This will now give you facet counts for all the other unfiltered items, and you would use these counts in the filter widget.

You'd want to do this 2nd query inside a <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/federated-multi-search.html`">`multi_search`</RouterLink> request, so it's still a single http request.

If you have multiple filter widgets, you would have to issue one additional query for each filter widget, that removes the particular filter for that widget, but keeps all other filters.

:::tip Live Example
To see a live example of the types of queries you'd need to generate, go to [songs-search.typesense.org](https://songs-search.typesense.org), open the browser's dev console, and then the network tab.

Type in "Hello" in the search bar, and then click on "The Beatles".

Now look for a request to `multi_search` in the browser's dev console network tab, and look at the structure of the queries generated.
:::

### What is the difference between filtering and faceting?

Let's say you have a [dataset of songs](https://songs-search.typesense.org/) like in the screenshot below.

The **_count_** next to each of the "Release Dates" and "Artists" on the left is obtained by faceting on the `release_date` and `artist` fields.

If you click on say "John Denver" and want to only fetch songs where the artist is "John Denver", that is called filtering.

## Indexing

### Why don't all my records from my database show up in Typesense when I sync my data?

If you're using the <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/documents.html#index-multiple-documents`">`import`</RouterLink> API endpoint to bulk import documents into Typesense, 
this endpoint returns an HTTP 200 in all cases, even if a few documents fail to import (to account for partial successes).

So your HTTP client might not be throwing an error even during an error. 

Always be sure to check the API response for any `{success: false, ...}` records to see if there are any documents that failed import, which usually happens due to schema validation errors.

You can use the <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/documents.html#returning-the-id-of-the-imported-documents`">`?return_id=true`</RouterLink> query parameter to get Typesense to return the exact document ID that errored out.

## Operations

### How do I get the memory usage for a single collection or field?

Typesense does not track memory usage by individual collections or fields. It only tracks memory metrics at an aggregate process-level. 
You can access these metrics using the <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/cluster-operations.html#cluster-metrics`">`GET /metrics.json`</RouterLink> endpoint.

### How do I set up HTTPS with Typesense?

By default, Typesense runs on port `8108` and serves HTTP traffic.

To enable HTTPS, you want to change the <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/server-configuration.html#networking`">`api-port`</RouterLink> to `443` and then use the <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/server-configuration.html#ssl-https`">`ssl-certificate` and `ssl-certificate-key`</RouterLink> parameters to point to your SSL certificate and SSL private key respectively.

Providers like [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) offer free SSL certificates.

## Releases

### When is the next version of Typesense launching?

We tend to add features and fixes on a continuous iterative cycle and publish RC (Release Candidate) builds every 1-2 weeks. Once the amount of changes have reached a critical mass, we then go into a feature freeze for the upcoming version, address a final round of last-mile issues if any, run performance benchmarks and regression tests, continuously dogfood the builds and if everything looks good we do a final GA (Generally Available) release.

We do not have a fixed timeline for GA releases since we want final builds to be sufficiently tested and stable. That said, in the past we've done [GA releases](https://github.com/typesense/typesense/releases) every 2-3 months.

In the meantime, most RC builds are safe to run in production. Read more here: [Can I run RC builds in production?](#can-i-run-rc-builds-in-production).

### How do you plan your roadmap?

We do Just-In-Time planning, at most 2 months in advance. Even within that window we tend to reprioritize based on your feedback. So items you see on [our roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/typesense/projects/1) more than one version out are subject to change.

While we generally tend to prioritize requests from our [Prioritized Support](https://typesense.org/support/) users, [Typesense Cloud](https://cloud.typesense.org/) users, our [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/typesense) and our open source Community Contributors, we also prioritize features based on the number of people asking for it, features/fixes that are small enough and can be addressed while we work on other related features, features/fixes that help improve stability & relevance and features that address interesting use cases that excite us!

If you'd like to have a request prioritized, we ask that you add a detailed use-case for it, either as a comment on an existing issue (in addition to a thumbs-up) or in a new issue. The detailed context you share about how you'd use the feature you're asking for helps significantly.

[View Roadmap »](https://github.com/orgs/typesense/projects/1)

### Can I run RC builds in production?

Usually yes. We tend to fix issues in RC builds pretty quickly. 

So if a build has been published for at least 1-2 weeks, and there are no newer builds, you should be safe to run that RC build in production.

You can find the published timestamps of the latest RC builds in our [Docker repo tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/typesense/typesense/tags?ordering=last_updated).

### How do I access RC builds?

If you're on Typesense Cloud, you'll find the latest RC build by going to Cluster Configuration > Modify > Typesense Server Version. 
RC builds are all the way at the bottom of this version selector dropdown.

If you're self-hosting Typesense, you can replace the version strings in the URLs in the [installation guide](./install-typesense.md) to the RC version for the Docker image, Linux binary, DEB and RPM packages.
We do not publish RC builds for other platforms.

## Firebase Extension

Here's a dedicated FAQ for the Firebase Extension: [https://github.com/typesense/firestore-typesense-search?tab=readme-ov-file#faqs](https://github.com/typesense/firestore-typesense-search?tab=readme-ov-file#faqs)

## Typesense Cloud

### What is the difference between Typesense Cloud and Self-Hosted version?

Here's how Typesense Cloud and Self-Hosted (on any VPS or other cloud) compare:

- **API Parity:** We run the same binaries we publish open source in Typesense Cloud as well, so the core APIs and features are the same.
- **Admin UI:** Typesense Self-Hosted is an API-only product. Whereas in Typesense Cloud we provide a UI to explore the data, setup synonyms, aliases, overrides, merchandizing, etc by pointing and clicking - ideal for non-technical members of your team to manage search behavior themselves, without having to take up engineering time. 
- **Managed Infrastructure:** In Typesense Cloud we take care of the infrastructure for you completely. As you scale, we can automatically scale your clusters for you (when you turn this setting on). Setting up a [Highly Available cluster](./high-availability.md), changing [cluster capacity](./system-requirements.md) and changing [Typesense versions](./updating-typesense.md) is point and click (or can be automated [via an API](/cloud-management-api/v1/README.md)) in Typesense Cloud, saving your infrastructure team valuable time.
- **Globally Distributed:** In Typesense Cloud, we offer a [Search Delivery Network](/guide/typesense-cloud/search-delivery-network.md) feature that works like a CDN, but we _replicate_ your full dataset to each of the regions you choose (unlike in a CDN where only frequently used items are kept on the edge), and the node that's closest to a searcher will respond to the search request. This reduces network latency and speeds up the search for your users around the world. 
- **Role-Based Access Control:** In Typesense Cloud, we give you Role Based Access control for members of your team, so you don’t have to share API keys with team members to give them selective access to different parts of the UI.
- **Switching Effort:** Since we run the same binaries, you can migrate between self-hosted and Typesense Cloud by just exporting and importing data.
- **Cost:** You'll have to compare the [pricing](https://cloud.typesense.org/pricing/) we publish on Typesense Cloud, with what it would cost to run an equivalent capacity VM(s) on your server hosting provider, plus add the engineering time required to self-host, manage infrastructure and keep up with updates. In general, we find that once you add engineering time, Typesense Cloud becomes cheaper, because we’re able to amortize engineering time on our side across all customers, bringing down costs for all users.
- **Support:** We offer [Prioritized Support](https://typesense.org/support/) on Typesense Cloud, whereas for Self-Hosted support is best-effort or usually [self-service](/help.md).
