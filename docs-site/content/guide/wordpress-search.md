## Setup and Configuration

Once the plugin has been installed and activated - we need to do someone initial setup.

### Setup

If you are hosting Typesense locally or on your own server, generate your API Keys following the instructions here: <RouterLink :to="`/${$site.themeConfig.typesenseLatestVersion}/api/api-keys.html`">Generate API Keys</RouterLink>.

If you are using Typesense Cloud, once the cluster is set up, click on "Generate API Keys" from your cluster's dashboard. 
This will generate and download API Keys to be used. 
Keep this file safe and secure for future use.

#### Enable Post Types
This option allows you to select which post types to index. By default, the plugin allows you to index posts and pages. 
There are WordPress action hooks and filters that allow adding custom post types.

#### Bulk Index
The bulk index option allows you to index all posts (post types) at once. 
You'll find options to

- Index
- Delete and Re-index (Only required if you have modified the schema (advanced usage).

#### Replace WordPress Search
Enabling this option will replace all WordPress default search widgets and forms with an autocomplete search form, powered by Typesense.

You can see an example of this [here](https://typesense.codemanas.com/autocomplete/).

#### Autocomplete Placeholder
This allows you to change the placeholder text for the autocomplete search (if replace WordPress search is enabled).

#### Autocomplete Input Delay
Allows you to define delay time after input from user before retrieving results. Minimum delay time is 300 milliseconds.

And that's it - you are ready to go.
