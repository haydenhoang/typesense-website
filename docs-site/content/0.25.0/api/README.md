## What's new

This release contains important new features and bug fixes.

### New Features

- **Semantic Search:** Search for conceptually related terms in your dataset, even if the exact keyword does not exist in your dataset. 
  - [Demo](https://hn-comments-search.typesense.org) | [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/0.25.0/api/vector-search.html#semantic-search)
- **Hybrid search:** Combine both keyword and semantic / vector search results in a single query using rank fusion
  - [Demo](https://hn-comments-search.typesense.org) | [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/0.25.0/api/vector-search.html#hybrid-search)
- **Automatic embedding generation:** specify one or more string fields that should be used for generating embeddings during indexing & during search using
    state-of-the-art embedding models, optionally [using a GPU](https://typesense.org/docs/0.25.0/api/vector-search.html#using-a-gpu-optional). 
  - [Example](https://github.com/typesense/showcase-hn-comments-semantic-search/blob/0a10f2ef34e01e79049e7ba42ae8660e80cf524f/scripts/indexDataInTypesense.js#L32-L45) | [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/0.25.0/api/vector-search.html#using-built-in-models)
- **Integration with OpenAI API, PaLM API and Vertex AI API:** Have Typesense automatically make API calls to remote embedding services like OpenAI / Google, to generate vectors for the JSON data you index in Typesense. 
  - [Example](https://github.com/typesense/showcase-hn-comments-semantic-search/blob/0a10f2ef34e01e79049e7ba42ae8660e80cf524f/scripts/indexDataInTypesense.js#L49-L67) | [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/0.25.0/api/vector-search.html#using-openai-api)
- **Query Analytics:** Typesense now supports aggregation of popular search queries which can then be used as insights into query patterns. [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/0.25.0/api/analytics-query-suggestions.html)
- **Query Suggestions:** You can use historical search terms collected by the Query Analytics feature, to power Query Suggestions.
  - [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/0.25.0/api/analytics-query-suggestions.html#query-suggestions)
- **Update Documents by Query:** You can now update all documents that match a `filter_by` condition
  - [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/0.25.0/api/documents.html#update-by-query)
- **Range faceting:** numerical values can be dynamically faceted at query-time by bucketing them into ranges.
  - [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/0.25.0/api/search.html#faceting-parameters)
- **Pagination using `offset` and `limit`**: This is in addition to the existing `page` and `per_page` mechanism. This new pagination method offers more flexibility and is also useful for GraphQL compatibility.
  - [Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/0.25.0/api/search.html#pagination-parameters)

### Enhancements

- Resolve field names using wildcard: fields can now be resolved in `facet_by`, `query_by`, `include_fields`, `exclude_fields`,
  `highlight_fields` and `highlight_full_fields` when a wildcard expression is used, e.g. `title_*` will match `title_en`.
- Ability to sort grouped hits based on the size of each group, using `sort_by: _group_found:desc`.
- A count is returned for total number of records under each group even if the hits are truncating via `group_limit`.
- The `!=` filtering operation can now be performed against numerical fields. Previously only string fields were supported for this operator.
- Support use of `preset` parameter in embedded API key.
- Support nested dynamic fields. 
- Migrated build system to Bazel.
- New server configuration option (`--reset-peers-on-error`) that makes the cluster forcefully refresh its peers when an
  unrecoverable clustering error happens due to sudden change of peer IPs. There's also an equivalent
  `/operations/reset_peers` API. Be careful while using this option, as it can lead to transient loss of data.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed updates of nested object field values.
- Fix geopoint indexing in nested fields.
- Fixed some special characters not getting highlighted properly in prefix searches.
- Fixed a bug in phrase matches on array.
- Fixed a socket leak on followers of a cluster when import data fails validation.
- Fixed high memory usage incurred in export/import of large datasets.
- Fixed bad unicode characters in export.
- Fixed errors that were caused by presence of bad Japanese unicode characters in import.
- Fixed broken http/2 support on CURL v8.
- Fixed non-curated members of a group appearing in curated override results.
- Fixed override query rule being case-sensitive.
- Fixed phrase search not considering field weights.

### Deprecations / behavior changes

There are no depreciation or behavior changes in this version.

## Upgrading

Before upgrading your existing Typesense cluster to v{{ $page.typesenseVersion }}, please review the behavior
changes above to prepare your application for the upgrade.

We'd recommend testing on your development / staging environments before upgrading. 

### Typesense Cloud

If you're on Typesense Cloud:

1. Go to [https://cloud.typesense.org/clusters](https://cloud.typesense.org/clusters).
2. Click on your cluster
3. Click on "Cluster Configuration" on the left-side pane, and then click on "Modify"
4. Schedule a time for the upgrade.

### Self Hosted

If you're self-hosting Typesense, here's how to upgrade:

#### Single node deployment

1. Trigger a snapshot to [create a backup](cluster-operations.md#create-snapshot-for-backups) of your data.
2. Stop Typesense server.
3. Replace the binary via the tar package or via the DEB/RPM installer. 
4. Start Typesense server back again.

#### Multi-node deployment

To upgrade a multi-node cluster, we will be proceeding node by node to ensure the cluster remains healthy during the rolling upgrade.

**NOTE:** During the upgrade, we have to ensure that the leader of the cluster is using the **older** Typesense version. 
So we will upgrade the leader last. You can determine whether a node is a leader or follower by the value of the `state` 
field in the `/debug` end-point response.

| State | Role     |
|-------|----------|
| 1     | LEADER   |
| 4     | FOLLOWER |

1. Trigger a snapshot to [create a backup](cluster-operations.md#create-snapshot-for-backups) of your data 
   on the leader node.
2. On any follower, stop Typesense and replace the binary via the tar package or via the DEB/RPM installer.
3. Start Typesense server back again and wait for node to rejoin the cluster as a follower and catch-up (`/health` should return healthy). 
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the other _followers_, leaving the leader node uninterrupted for now.
5. Once all followers have been upgraded to v{{ $page.typesenseVersion }}, stop Typesense on the leader.
6. The other nodes will elect a new leader and keep working. 
7. Replace the binary on the old leader and start the Typesense server back again. 
8. This node will re-join the cluster as a follower, and we are done.


## Downgrading

Once you upgrade to `v0.25` of Typesense Server the internal structure of the data directory becomes incompatible with older versions of Typesense. 

However, if you need to downgrade to `v0.24`, we've released a special version `v0.24.2` that backports these data structure changes back to `0.24` while keeping other `0.24.1` features as is.

So `v0.25` can only be downgraded to `v0.24.2`.
