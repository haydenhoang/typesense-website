## What's new

This release contains important new features, performance improvements and bug fixes.

### New Features

- **Natural Language Search:** Typesense can now convert natural language queries into structured search queries for you, using LLMs. 
  This allows a user query like `q: A Honda or BMW with at least 200 hp` to be understood and executed by Typesense as `filter_by: make:[Honda, BMW] && engine_hp:>=200` automatically. ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/natural-language-search.html))
- **Dynamic Sorting in Overrides:** Typesense now supports dynamic sorting rules within override definitions, similar to dynamic filtering.
  This enables query-dependent sorting of results through override rules ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/curation.html#dynamic-sorting)).
- **Filter for two properties within a nested array of objects**: You can now scope filter expressions to a specific nested object within an array field ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/guide/tips-for-filtering.html#filtering-nested-array-objects)).
- **Streaming support for conversations:** responses from LLM APIs are now directly streamed, allowing you to build interactive chat experiences. ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/conversational-search-rag.html#streaming-conversations)).
- **Support adding meta fields to query analytics documents**: You can now pass the `filter_by` search parameter and a new `analytics_tag` search parameter that you can set to any string you need, to be stored with your popular and no-hits queries. This gives you additional context around the search. ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/analytics-query-suggestions.html#query-analytics-with-meta-fields)).
- You can now fetch JOIN reference fields in the GET document API ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/joins.html#reference-fields-in-document-retrieval))

### Enhancements

- Improved group-by performance and resource usage, especially when high cardinality fields (like `productId`) are used for grouping.
- Improved performance of numeric range queries.
- Return uniform API response structure when `union: true` is set, regardless of number of collections queried.
- Ability to customize RocksDB parameters like write buffer sizes for better performance. ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/server-configuration.html#on-disk-db-fine-tuning)).
- Support for filtering with nested object fields in overrides.
- Ability to do image search using user-uploaded images at runtime ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/image-search.html#search-for-similar-images-with-dynamic-image)).
- Support for configuring the max `group_limit` via a new server-side parameter called `max-group-limit` ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/server-configuration.html#search-limits)).
- Support caching for remote query embeddings via `embedding-cache-num-entries` server-side parameter ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/server-configuration.html#resource-usage)).
- Support for sorting when doing a one-to-many JOIN ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/joins.html#sorting-on-one-to-many-joins)).
- Support for bucketing on vector distance ([Docs](https://typesense.org/docs/29.0/api/vector-search.html#vector-distance-bucketing)).
- Improved synonym matching when multiple synonym definitions match a given search query. 
- New Cache hit/miss statistics (`cache_hit_count`, `cache_miss_count`, `cache_hit_ratio`) are now exposed in `stats.json`
- Support for Azure OpenAI and Google Gemini in conversation models.
- Support dimension truncation for GCP text embedding models, by setting `num_dim`.
- Add support for Azure OpenAI for embedding generation.
- Support for `document_task` and `query_task` support for GCP text embedding models.
- Support for OpenAI compatible conversation models using the `openai_url` (base) and `openai_path` parameters.
- The region parameter is now configurable for GCP models for text embedding.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a few bugs related to updates of deeply nested field values.
- Fixed phrase search queries being stemmed.
- Respect field-level tokenization config in filters.
- Fixed facet sum being wrong when negative values are added.
- Fixed vector query parsing with backticks escaping special characters. 
- Improve reliability of joins during imports.
- Fixed broken `cache-num-entries` server side parameter.
- Exclude x-typesense-user-id from cache key to make cache global. 
- Fixed import of large stemming dictionaries.
- Fixed auth token refreshing problem for GCP-based embedding generation.
- Fixed vector search not working reliably with 3 `sort_by` fields.
- Fixed a bug caused by using `flat_search_cutoff` along with filtering for vector search.
- Tweak rank computation for fusion scoring - two keyword search results with same text match score should have the same keyword search rank.
- Improved reliability of CLIP embeddings under high concurrency.
- Fixed a bug with collection truncation, requiring unnecessary parameters. 
- Fixed a bug where the alter operations endpoint was returning the incorrect document counter.
- Fixed a bug where analytics counters only worked with int32 fields.

### Deprecations / behavior changes

-  For `group_by` queries, the `found` value returned in the response is no longer an exact number. It's an 
   approximation of the number of groups found, and is guaranteed to be within 2% of the actual number of groups found.

## Upgrading

Before upgrading your existing Typesense cluster to v{{ $page.typesenseVersion }}, please review the behavior
changes above to prepare your application for the upgrade.

We'd recommend testing on your development / staging environments before upgrading. 

Follow this [upgrade guide](https://typesense.org/docs/guide/updating-typesense.html), depending on your mode of deployment. 


## Downgrading

If you wish to downgrade back to an earlier version of Typesense server, you can safely downgrade to `v28` of `v27`.
