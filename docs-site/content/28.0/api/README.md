## What's new

This release contains important new features, performance improvements and bug fixes.

### New Features

- Support union / merging of search results across collections containing similar type of fields. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/2051)
- Dictionary based stemming: stemming is now configurable through an import of a custom dictionary that maps a word to a root form. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/2062) 
- Allow search results to be randomized via `sort_by=_rand(seed)` clause. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/1918)
- Ability to re-rank hybrid search hits by augmenting their keyword / semantic match score when the 
  hit was identified by only either keyword or vector search. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/1968)
- Sort hits based on a pivot value. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/2003) 
- Support decay functions in `sort_by` to support gaussian, linear, and exponential decay of values. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/2036) 
- Field level `token_separators` and `symbols_to_index` are now supported. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/2118)
- Support bucketing of text match scores based on `bucket_size` parameter. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/2120)
- Ability to truncate a collection. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/2127)
- Index and search on geo polygons. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/2150)

### Enhancements

- Support `distance_threshold` parameter for vector query that uses inner product distance.
- Allow updating of remote model's `api_key` parameter. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/1944)
- Support `max_filter_by_candidates` search parameter that controls the number of similar words that Typesense.
  considers during fuzzy search on `filter_by` values (default is `4`).
- Performance and stability fixes for joins.
- API endpoint that returns status of alter schema operations that are in-progress. (https://github.com/typesense/typesense/pull/2123)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed fields with `async_reference` property not being restored correctly on restart. 
- Fixed sorting with nested reference fields.
- Addressed edge cases in conversation API.
- Assign default sorting score if reference is not found while sorting by a reference field.
- Fix `distance_threshold` in `vector_query` not working correctly while sorting.
- Add validation to ensure that embedding fields are of type `float[]`.
- Fix vector query format validation error messages.
- Fix race condition in high concurrency image embedding.
- Fix `flat_search_cutoff` not working for hybrid search.

### Deprecations / behavior changes

There are no deprecations / behavior changes in this release.

## Upgrading

Before upgrading your existing Typesense cluster to v{{ $page.typesenseVersion }}, please review the behavior
changes above to prepare your application for the upgrade.

We'd recommend testing on your development / staging environments before upgrading. 

### Typesense Cloud

If you're on Typesense Cloud:

1. Go to [https://cloud.typesense.org/clusters](https://cloud.typesense.org/clusters).
2. Click on your cluster
3. Click on "Cluster Configuration" on the left-side pane, and then click on "Modify"
4. Select a new Typesense Server version in the dropdown
5. Schedule a time for the upgrade.

### Self Hosted

If you're self-hosting Typesense, here's how to upgrade:

#### Single node deployment

1. Trigger a snapshot to [create a backup](https://typesense.org/docs/27.1/api/cluster-operations.html#create-snapshot-for-backups) of your data, for safety purposes.
2. Stop Typesense server.
3. Replace the binary via the tar package or via the DEB/RPM installer. 
4. Start Typesense server back again.

#### Multi-node deployment

To upgrade a multi-node cluster, we will be proceeding node by node to ensure the cluster remains healthy during the rolling upgrade.

**NOTE:** During the upgrade, we have to ensure that the leader of the cluster is using the **older** Typesense version. 
So we will upgrade the leader last. You can determine whether a node is a leader or follower by the value of the `state` 
field in the `/debug` end-point response.

| State | Role     |
|-------|----------|
| 1     | LEADER   |
| 4     | FOLLOWER |

1. Trigger a snapshot to [create a backup](https://typesense.org/docs/27.1/api/cluster-operations.html#create-snapshot-for-backups) of your data 
   on the leader node.
2. On any follower, stop Typesense and replace the binary via the tar package or via the DEB/RPM installer.
3. Start Typesense server back again and wait for node to rejoin the cluster as a follower and catch-up (`/health` should return healthy). 
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the other _followers_, leaving the leader node uninterrupted for now.
5. Once all followers have been upgraded to v{{ $page.typesenseVersion }}, stop Typesense on the leader.
6. The other nodes will elect a new leader and keep working. 
7. Replace the binary on the old leader and start the Typesense server back again. 
8. This node will re-join the cluster as a follower, and we are done.


## Downgrading

If you wish to downgrade back to an earlier version of Typesense server, you can safely downgrade to `v27`.
